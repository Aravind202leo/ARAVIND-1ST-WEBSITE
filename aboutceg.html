    <p>
      The oldest technical institute in the country has witnessed historic
      milestones. Its distinguished alumni have put it on the global map, and
      the story of its evolution mirrors that of engineering itself. The College
      of Engineering, Guindy, Chennai, stands for tradition, pride and
      path-breaking work Walking across the vast campus, opposite Gandhi
      Mandapam on Chennai’s Sardar Patel Road , is an illuminating experience.
      The winding tar road that leads you inside the campus, is flanked by
      monuments and shrouded in verdant stretches of land. On one side, is a
      temple-like structure, while on the other, is a gaggle of youngsters
      lazing around on stone benches, catching up on gossip, exchanging notes,
      or just grabbing some “me” time. But the pièce de résistance is the
      majestic Red Stone building that looms before you, filling you with an
      inexplicable sense of purpose. This year, the College of Engineering,
      Guindy (CEG) has entered its 225th year.India’s first engineering college,
      CEG was started in 1794 as School of Survey, and established as a college
      in 1859. At present, it has 23 departments and 590 colleges affiliated to
      it. Over the years, the college has witnessed a sea-change in the manner
      in which engineering has evolved. Anna University’s Vice Chancellor, M.K.
      Surappa, traces the evolution of engineering over the years, his pride
      palpable. “A gradual paradigm shift, in our country’s engineering
      education, has been visible in the last 200 years. Today, technology which
      we had never imagined could exist, has moulded our lives in unthinkable
      ways,” he believes.“During the pre-independence years, engineers were
      taught about surveying, building bridges, and canals. Soon after
      independence, however, we had innumerable challenges — we were below the
      poverty line, people were starving, and we lacked infrastructure other
      than the railways and the British canal systems. Gradually, engineers
      built steel plants. Public sector undertakings such as HAL, ITI, and
      others, emerged. Thus, our main focus was to ensure that we had
      engineering graduates who were adept in the fields of mechanical, civil,
      electrical, and aerospace engineering. Naturally, the intake in the field
      increased. Today, it has been further revolutionised with the advent of
      the Internet, paving way for the digital era,” the VC continues. “Today,
      engineering is no more a subject that flies solo; over the years, it has
      taken on an interdisciplinary aspect. It is not enough, for instance, for
      engineers to
